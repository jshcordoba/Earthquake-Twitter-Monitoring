   <h1> Feed Output </h1>
   <br>
   <p>
       Below is the output from the Earthquake Feed I created. Earthquake data
       is pulled from the USGS api (https://www.usgs.gov) and tweet data is
       retrieved from the Twitter api.

      <p> Below is a summary table of data that pertains to
          the last earthquake that occured. The image will update whenever there
      is a new earthquake since the link used in the image tag is from my
      S3 bucket.</p>

         alt="Opps, there's supposed to be an image here :/">
      <p> Below is a wordcloud of the tweets that were scraped from the area where the
      earthquake occured. If the earthquake occured in an obscure, frozen over part of
      Alaska, then the wordcloud will be made up of "Tweets Not Available in Area"
      or something along those lines. The image will update whenever there
      is a new earthquake since the link used in the image tag is from my
      S3 bucket.</p>
